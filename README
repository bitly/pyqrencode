Tested on:
 * Mac OSX 10.6.4 Snow Leopard, Python 2.6.1 (64-bit)
 * CentOS 5.5, Python 2.6.4 (64-bit)
 * Ubuntu Precise Pangolin 10.12, Python 2.7.3 (64-bit) (depends on package libqrencode-dev)

Pre-requisites on all platforms:
--------------------------------
 * you need libqrencode somewhere in your LD path (/usr/local/lib)
 * you need qrencode.h somewhere on your include path (/usr/local/include)
 
 ** if you want to play with the code generation you need Cython (tested with 0.13)
     $ easy_install cython
     $ cython qrencode.pyx


Installation
------------
$ python setup.py install
